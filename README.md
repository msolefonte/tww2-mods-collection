# Collection of mods for Total War: Warhammer II

Years ago, in 2017, I was a huge fan of Total War: Warhammer and decided to support the community by developing a set of 
mods that I shared for free at the Steam Workshop. Three years later, some of these mods have more than five thousand 
active users, having been the total userbase of them of more than one hundred thousand of users.

Now, after some time, I have decided to port some of them to Total War: Warhammer II, as well as to create new mods to 
keep on giving. The current list is the following:
